      "contents": "\r\nKirkton Public Library was the main library of the town of Kirkton. On July 15th, 2021, sometime after Ms. Thomson let the dog out but before Mr. Covington put his children to bed, a loud explosion marked what is now presumed to be the obliteration of the library. During the clearance of rubble from what was previously the non-fiction section, scraps of paper (now involuntary excerpts) were found that did not match any source online, nor to the best of chief librarian Jim Reilly’s memory. Always one to leap at the opportunity to acquire new literature (particularly now), Mr. Reilly proposed these mystery fragments be transcribed and uploaded to the internet as they were found. These are those transcriptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
