The truth of the matter is that neural networks cannot obtain information that was not there to begin with. Their power comes from their ability to have a pool of experience so vast that nearly any novel scenario has hundreds nearly identical known scenarios. This perceived flexibility often hides a crippling rigidity. A truly novel experience, where any reasonable human would throw in the towel, is happily churned away by the machine. A warning to those who perceive AI as our unbiased saving grace: Everything is made by humans.
